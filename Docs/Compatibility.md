# Compatibility

RunBridge sits between your treadmill and your Garmin watch. It relies on two things:

1. An **FTMS-enabled treadmill** that broadcasts over Bluetooth.
2. A **Garmin watch** that supports external speed/cadence / footpod sensors.

**Developed Using:** Assault Runner Pro + Garmin Fenix 7

**Confirmed working with:** Spirit XT685

## Supported (in general)

### Treadmills

RunBridge is designed for treadmills whose consoles advertise **FTMS** over Bluetooth:

- Often described as “Bluetooth FTMS”, “FTMS compatible”, or “supports Zwift/third-party apps”.
- Many modern commercial and prosumer treadmills fall into this category.

If your treadmill works with apps like Zwift or Kinomap over Bluetooth (without extra dongles), it’s a **good sign** it uses FTMS.

> Note: Some treadmills only broadcast FTMS once a workout is started.

### Watches

Most running and multisport watches that support:

- **Foot Pod** sensors, and/or
- **Running Speed/Cadence** sensors

are **likely compatible** with RunBridge.

Check your watch under:

> **Settings → Sensors & Accessories → Add New**

If you see **Foot Pod** or **Running Speed/Cadence**, that’s a strong sign your watch supports the sensor type RunBridge broadcasts.

## Not supported / poor fit

RunBridge is **not** a good fit if:

- Your treadmill only supports:
  - Proprietary app connections (e.g., brand-only apps) with no FTMS exposed
  - Bluetooth audio (headphone icon only)
- Your watch:
  - Does not support external running sensors
  - Cannot pair to a Bluetooth footpod or running speed/cadence sensor

## Quick FTMS check with nRF Connect (optional)

If you’re comfortable using a phone app, you can roughly confirm FTMS support using **nRF Connect for Mobile** by Nordic Semiconductor (free on iOS and Android).

### Steps

1. **Install the app**
   - Search for **“nRF Connect for Mobile”** in the App Store or Google Play.
   - Install and open it.

2. **Get close to the treadmill**
   - Stand near the treadmill console.
   - Make sure the treadmill is powered on and Bluetooth is enabled.

3. **Scan for devices**
   - In nRF Connect, go to the **Scanner** tab.
   - Tap **Scan**.
   - If needed, start a simple workout on the treadmill so it begins broadcasting.

4. **Find your treadmill**
   - Look for a device name that matches your treadmill brand/model, or something clearly related to it.
   - Tap that device in the list.

5. **Check for FTMS / Fitness Machine service**
   - After connecting, look at the list of services.
   - You’re interested in a service named **“Fitness Machine”** or with the UUID **0x1826**.
   - Some apps also label this as **FTMS** or **Fitness Machine Service**.

If you see a Fitness Machine / FTMS service (UUID 0x1826), that’s a strong sign your treadmill is a good match for RunBridge.

If you don’t see it:

- The treadmill might not expose FTMS
- Or it may only advertise FTMS after a specific mode/workout is started
- Or it only talks to a proprietary phone app
