# RunBridge

RunBridge is a small, standalone Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) bridge that connects **FTMS-compatible treadmills** to **GPS running watches** using standard BLE services.

It lets your watch receive **accurate pace and distance** directly from the treadmill instead of relying on wrist-based estimation or a separate footpod.

Cadence is **estimated from pace** on the bridge (since most treadmills do not expose true step data), and is best treated as an approximate value.

RunBridge is **not brand-specific** and does **not** require any proprietary phone apps.

## What RunBridge Does

- Connects to treadmills that broadcast **FTMS (Fitness Machine Service)**
- Re-broadcasts treadmill **speed and distance**, and **estimates cadence from pace**, using **RSC (Running Speed and Cadence)**
- Appears to your watch like a standard footpod / running speed & cadence sensor
- Works fully offline — no phone, no app, no Wi-Fi
- Runs on a **Seeed XIAO nRF52840** board in a small 3D-printed enclosure

Because cadence is estimated from speed, it’s useful for getting a rough number in your data, but it will not be as precise as a true footpod or wrist/HR-based cadence source.

## Why RunBridge Exists

Indoor running accuracy has always been a compromise:

- Wrist-based estimation drifts
- Manual calibration fixes totals but not mile/km splits
- Footpods add cost, require calibration, and don’t always match the treadmill

RunBridge solves this by acting as a **protocol bridge**, not an estimator for distance.

Your watch receives **the treadmill’s own speed and distance** via standard BLE RSC, using interfaces it already understands. Cadence is filled in based on pace so your data looks consistent, but distance and pace are the primary, accurate values.

---

## Quick Start (Short Version)

See the full guide at [`Docs/QuickStart.md`](Docs/QuickStart.md). High level:

1. **Power On**  
   Plug RunBridge into any 5V USB power source (treadmill USB port, battery pack, or wall adapter).  
   If your treadmill or console has a Bluetooth toggle, make sure **Bluetooth is turned on**.

2. **Pair Your Watch (one-time)**  
   - **Garmin (e.g., Fenix 7):**  
     `Settings → Sensors & Accessories → Add New → Foot Pod`  
     Select **RunBridge**.
   - Other brands: look for **Footpod** or **Running Speed/Cadence** sensor options.

3. **Connect to Treadmill**  
   - Power on the treadmill and, if needed, start a basic workout so it starts broadcasting FTMS.
   - RunBridge will scan and connect automatically.

4. **Run**  
   - Start an **Indoor Run / Treadmill** activity on your watch.  
   - Pace and distance should track the treadmill display.  
   - Cadence will be estimated from pace on the bridge.

No phone or app is required once things are paired.

## LED Status Guide (XIAO nRF52840)

RunBridge uses the XIAO’s RGB LED to show state. Full details are in [`Docs/LED-States.md`](Docs/LED-States.md).

| LED Pattern (XIAO)         | Meaning                                           |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Solid green**            | System Ready – watch subscribed + treadmill connected |
| **Double blink red**       | Treadmill Only – FTMS treadmill connected, waiting for watch |
| **Fast blink magenta**     | Watch Connected – watch connected, not yet subscribed |
| **Slow blink blue**        | Scanning – watch subscribed, searching for treadmill |
| **Off**                    | Idle / Sleep – no active connections              |

During a normal run you should end up in **solid green** most of the time.

## Tested Watches

RunBridge targets watches that support external footpod / running speed & cadence sensors.

Confirmed working:

- **Garmin Fenix 7** (Fenix 7 Pro Sapphire Solar variant)

RunBridge uses standard BLE RSC, which is supported by many modern GPS running watches. Other Garmin, COROS, Suunto, and Polar models *should* work if they support external footpod / RSC sensors, but they have not been individually verified.

If you test with a different watch, please report your results.

> Note: Cadence on the watch will be coming from RunBridge’s pace-based estimate unless you configure the watch to use another cadence source (e.g., wrist/HR or a dedicated footpod).

---

## Tested Treadmills

RunBridge has been tested and confirmed working with:

- **AssaultRunner Pro** (FTMS-enabled console)

In principle, RunBridge should work with any treadmill that:

- Broadcasts **FTMS** (Fitness Machine Service, UUID `0x1826`) over BLE, and  
- Implements speed and distance characteristics reasonably close to the spec.

Many modern treadmills advertise FTMS support (NordicTrack, Peloton, Woodway, Life Fitness, Technogym, etc.), but **implementations vary**. Some:

- Only broadcast once a workout is active
- Use non-standard fields
- Hide FTMS behind a proprietary app

Compatibility with untested models is **not guaranteed**.

---

## Checking FTMS with nRF Connect

A quick way to sanity-check your treadmill is with **nRF Connect for Mobile** (free on iOS / Android). Full instructions are in [`Docs/Compatibility.md`](Docs/Compatibility.md); short version:

1. Install **“nRF Connect for Mobile”** on your phone.
2. Stand near the treadmill, power it on, and enable Bluetooth.
3. In nRF Connect, open the **Scanner** tab and tap **Scan**.
4. Identify your treadmill and connect to it.
5. Look for a service named **“Fitness Machine”** or with UUID **`0x1826`**.

If you see a Fitness Machine / FTMS service, that’s a strong sign your treadmill is a good candidate for RunBridge (but not a guarantee).

If you’re not sure what you’re seeing, grab a screenshot and email it to  
`hello@runbridge.dev`.

## Troubleshooting

The full troubleshooting guide lives in [`Docs/Troubleshooting.md`](Docs/Troubleshooting.md). Common issues:

- **Watch won’t find RunBridge**
  - Confirm RunBridge is powered (LED not completely off).
  - Make sure Bluetooth is enabled on your treadmill console if it has a setting.
  - Move the watch close during pairing.
  - Remove the existing sensor entry on the watch and re-pair.

- **Treadmill won’t connect**
  - Ensure treadmill Bluetooth is enabled.
  - Some treadmills only broadcast FTMS after a workout is started.
  - Place RunBridge close to the console.

- **Distance or pace looks wrong**
  - Confirm your watch is using the **footpod** as the pace/distance source.
  - Make sure you stayed in **System Ready (solid green)** most of the workout.
  - Minor differences are normal; large ones may indicate a treadmill quirk.

- **Cadence looks odd**
  - Remember cadence is **estimated from speed**, not measured from your steps.
  - If your watch offers another cadence source (wrist/HR, footpod), you can configure it to use that instead.

If you’re stuck, send details (watch model, treadmill model, LED behavior, screenshots / photos) to `support@runbridge.dev`.

## How It Works (Technical Overview)

1. RunBridge advertises as an **RSC sensor** and waits for your watch to connect.
2. Once the watch is connected, it scans for nearby **FTMS** treadmills.
3. It connects to the treadmill and subscribes to FTMS speed/distance notifications.
4. Incoming FTMS data is transformed into **Running Speed and Cadence (RSC)** format:
   - Speed and distance come directly from the treadmill.
   - Cadence is derived from speed using a simple estimation model.
5. The watch sees the data as if it came from a normal footpod.

All logic runs directly on the device. No cloud, no app, no phone.

## Firmware

- Firmware is **closed-source** and pre-flashed.
- It is intended to be **appliance-style** for end users — no routine firmware updates are required.
- The latest firmware binary (**CURRENT.UF2**) is available in this repository under [`Firmware/`](Firmware/) and on the [web site Updater page](https://runbridge.dev/updater.html). You can update your device via USB drag-and-drop (double-tap Reset to enter update mode, then copy the UF2 file onto the device drive).
- If a critical issue is ever found, update instructions will be published in the Docs and on the GitHub repo.

Internally, the firmware includes:

- A watchdog for automatic recovery from rare lockups
- State-driven BLE management for the FTMS (treadmill) and RSC (watch) sides
- Robust distance handling that prefers **treadmill odometer** when available, with sensible fallback
- A cadence estimation layer based on treadmill speed
- LED state machine to make it obvious what’s going on (see [`Docs/LED-States.md`](Docs/LED-States.md))

This repository contains the firmware **binary** (UF2) for updates but **does not** contain firmware source code.
